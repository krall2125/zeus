# zeus - the perfect esoteric programming languagewirtenn in Odin
it's perfect. literally perfect. it currently has 2 standards. z1 is the most minimalistic one and contains only 4 operations. every operation is one character long.

## z1 standard
- introduced `+` which increments the storage cell
- introduced `-` which decrements the storage cell
- introduced `.` which prints the storage cell as a number
- introduced `:` which prints the storage cell as a char

## z2 standard
- introduced `*` which multiplies the storage cell by 2
- introduced `/` which divides the storage cell by 2
- introduced `0` which resets the storage cell to 0
- introduced `{` which pushes the storage cell onto a stack
- introduced `}` which pops the storage cell from a stack
