c.  c++ c# whats the difference holyc c-- cigmaballs stellar-clang
perfect litera;y perfet you get it its just perfect programing lanhg
kinda like brainfuck but also not

## zeus-1 machine (Z1 is getting rebranded)
- `+` to increment storage cell
- `-` to decrement the storage cell
- `.` to print it as number
- `:` to print it as char

## zeus-2 machine (z2 but yeswessssssjdsklsdxkjnmjzjsd)
- i need immediate mental help
- `*` does stuff on the storage cell
- `/` does stuff on the storage cell
- `0` resets storage cell to 0
- `@` jumps to instruction #storage_cell (depending on the conditional flag CF unconditionally if 0, conditionally if 1)

## zeus-3 machine (z3 yes balsl)
- `?` toggle conditional flag (default 0)
