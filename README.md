# zeus - the perfect esoteric programming languagewirtenn in ~Odin~ C
c.  c++ c# whats the difference holyc c-- cigmaballs stellar-clang
perfect litera;y perfet you get it its just perfect programing lanhg
kinda like brainfuck but also not

## zeus-1 machine (Z1 is getting rebranded)
- `+` to increment storage cell
- `-` to decrement the storage cell
- `.` to print it as number
- `:` to print it as char

## zeus-2 machine (z2 but yeswessssssjdsklsdxkjnmjzjsd)
- `*` multiply storage cell by 2
- `/` divide storage cell by 2
- `0` resets storage cell to 0
- `@` add storage cell to the instruction pointer (jump by storage cell offset) (depending on the conditional flag CF unconditionally if 0, conditionally if 1)
- `?` toggle conditional flag (default 0)
- `=` compare the storage cell with the top of the stack (equality)
- `p` push the storage cell to the top of the stack
- `q` pop from the stack into the storage cell
- `\` swap the storage cell with the thing atop the stack
- `$` duplicate the value atop the stack
