# zeus - the perfect esoteric programming languagewirtenn in Odin
it's perfect. literally perfect. it currently has 3 standards. z1 is the most minimalistic one and contains only 4 operations. every operation is one character long.

## z1 standard
- introduced `+` which increments the storage cell
- introduced `-` which decrements the storage cell
- introduced `.` which prints the storage cell as a number
- introduced `:` which prints the storage cell as a char

## z2 standard
- introduced `*` which multiplies the storage cell by 2
- introduced `/` which divides the storage cell by 2
- introduced `0` which resets the storage cell to 0
- introduced `{` which pushes the storage cell onto a stack
- introduced `}` which pops the storage cell from a stack

## z3 standard
- introduced `p` which is the parf operation
- introduced `?` which checks if the storage is 0 and if that's true jumps to either the end or else branch
- introduced `!` which is the else branch
- introduced `)` which is the end of a block
